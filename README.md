# German_Traffic_Sign_Classification
German-Traffic-Sign-Classification The goal of this project is to predict categorical identities of German traffic sign images using Neural Networks.  Project Description This project was in response to a hackathon ncompetition available on Kaggle. As mentioned, the challenge required developing a classification model to identify traffic signs, Various traffic sign images were trained using neural networks models . For this analysis the metric of success was an accuracy of atleast 90%.  Technologies Used Various Python Libraries  Usage This project demonstrates how various neural networks can be applied to solve a real world problem.
